\section{Angular Dependence} \label{sec:angDependence}
Directions of the final state particles in the four-body decay of a spinless particle are specified
by three decay angles. In this section, the dependence of the differential decay rate on these
angles is derived. Results are valid for all four-body decays, although the decay
\BdtomumuKstKpi{} is used as an example.
